--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Have you used any fitness trackers before, if so what did you like/dislike?

A: Did use a fitness tracker via a game- RingFit: Liked that it was interactive and displayed what parts of the body were being trained for each exercise and the benefits of training them.
B: Have not used any fitness trackers yet.
C: Fitbit, mainly for steps many years ago, not used one for years though - liked having steps/total distance covered a day tracked.
D: Yes, I had a smartwatch previously and enjoyed how I could quickly see how I was doing my current progress, but the one I was using had constant notifications in things like diet and water and I found it like a bit invasive and annoying, so I stopped using it
E: Yeah, I had a smartwatch and liked how I could have it on when playing sports and during matches which I couldn’t with my phone.
F: Yeah, I've tried a few fitness trackers before. I liked how they kept me motivated, but sometimes the data felt overwhelming.
G: Yes, I've dabbled with a couple of fitness trackers in the past. I appreciated how they kept me accountable, but at times, the interface felt a bit cluttered.
H: Yeah, I've experimented with a couple of fitness trackers before. They were great for keeping me on track, but sometimes all the data felt a bit overwhelming.
I: I've extensively used fitness trackers, and I love the real-time data updates. It keeps me motivated and accountable. Sometimes, the overwhelming notifications about diet and water intake can be distracting during workouts.
J: I've tried a few fitness trackers. I appreciate their simplicity and how they subtly remind me to stay active. The cluttered interface of some trackers can be confusing, and I don't need constant notifications.
K: I've used a fitness tracker occasionally. It's nice to see the steps, but I don't delve too much into detailed stats. Haven't faced any significant issues, but too much emphasis on tracking feels unnecessary for my sporadic workouts.
L: I’ve used a few before. I used to use a Fitbit watch to track my fitness, but I switched to an Apple Watch because of how much nicer it looks and the aesthetic. However, it was very hard to get used to due to the different functions on the watch, and it can be quite distracting when it is linked to my iPhone due to receiving so many notifications.
M: I’ve used a fitness tracking app on my phone, but it is quite inconvenient because I have to always keep my phone in my pocket or in my hand for it to track any fitness goals which is quite annoying.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Are there any design elements of apps you have used previously that you found challenging or confusing?

A: Dislike being confronted with too much information at once when first using an app.
B: Have not used fitness apps previously.
C: Sometimes find functionality confusing when not properly explained, especially when using an app for the first time.
D: I dislike it when apps have too much information on a screen and I get confused on where to go or click to get to the next section, especially if I take a break for a while. I prefer apps to be streamlined with a menu bar preferably.
E: Not really, I generally understand how to use and get around an app after the first time through just playing around with it and clicking a few buttons
F: Oh, definitely! Some app designs can be a bit tricky to navigate, especially when there are too many buttons or menus.
G: Oh, for sure! Some app layouts can be a bit puzzling, especially when there's an overload of tabs and icons to sift through.
H: Oh, definitely! Some app designs can be a bit tricky to navigate, especially when there's too much going on with buttons and menus.
I: Navigating apps with too many buttons and options is a challenge for me. I prefer a clean and straightforward interface.
J: I find it challenging when apps have too many options on one screen. A straightforward menu bar makes navigation easier for me.
K: I find some apps confusing, especially when they don't explain features clearly. Simple designs are more appealing to me.
L: One confusing element I came across is when there are too many menus or functions. I just want a simple app to track calories and time spent exercising.
M: Most apps are easy to use once I start exploring the different functions, but I’d prefer an app to be simple and quick to grasp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) What are your fitness goals?

A: Want to achieve a better physique for my height and weight.
B: Bulk up/build more muscle mass.
C: Always improve and keep getting as strong/fit as possible.
D: I’d like to both lose weight and gain some muscle at the same time
E: I play a lot of sports, that involve running so probably time spent running to track my stamina
F: My fitness goals are to improve my overall strength and endurance while staying consistent with my workouts.
G: My fitness aspirations revolve around enhancing my strength and stamina while maintaining a consistent workout routine.
H: My fitness goals are all about building up my strength and endurance while making sure I stick to my workout routine.
I: My fitness goals revolve around achieving a balanced physique with a focus on muscle definition and maintaining overall health.
J: My fitness goals are more about staying active and exploring different exercises without strict routines. It's about feeling good rather than intense training.
K: My fitness goals are more about staying active without specific targets. I exercise when I can but don't follow a strict regimen.
L: My main fitness goal is to lose weight and turn my fat into muscle. I want to lose 10KG.
M: I want to eat healthier, so I want to track my calories and compare the junk food I eat to the healthy food that I need to eat. I also want to get stronger in all muscle groups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Do you have any preferences for certain types of exercises?

A: Preference towards core and legs, tend not to focus on arm exercises due to ADHD (difficulty focusing on muscle groups I don't enjoy training).
B: Mainly upper body with a dislike towards leg exercises.
C: Cardio, my preference is always running - leg, core and arm strength training always do "at-home" exercises, as don't like how busy gyms are, and how much longer gym takes.
D: Things like Zumba and more upbeat activities, and preferably running or cardio not exactly lifting weights
E: Mostly running stats, time spent running and distance etc. That’s pretty much what I am looking at even when tracking other activities such as playing netball.
F: I enjoy a mix of cardio and strength training, but I'm always open to trying new workout styles.
G: I gravitate towards a blend of cardiovascular exercises and strength training, but I'm always game to explore new workout modalities.
H: I enjoy mixing things up with cardio and strength training, but I'm open to trying out different workout styles too.
I: I prefer a mix of strength training and high-intensity cardio. Variety in exercises, especially those targeting specific muscle groups, keeps my workouts engaging.
J: I enjoy a mix of activities like yoga, hiking, and casual runs. I don't have a specific routine but prefer variety.
K: I prefer light exercises and occasional walks. No specific preferences, just keeping it simple.
L: I like cardio–based exercises that are fun, running seems boring. And also exercises that are proven to grow muscles fast because I want to lose weight and fat and gain muscle.
M: I prefer strength training because I want to get stronger. Also, because it has helped me grow muscles fast and increase my strength drastically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) What are the biggest challenges you face in staying motivated to exercise and track your fitness goals?

A: ADHD, anything that doesn't keep me actively engaged makes me lose interest. Tend to track fitness through change in resistance over time (the feel of the weights) rather than noting down exact measurements.
B: Lack of over-arching goal to be motivated towards past wanting to be fitter.
C: Never really waivered in terms of motivation, I would like to track my fitness better, but need a new and better phone for a fitness app, or need money to buy a watch tracker.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) How important is social interaction and community support in your fitness journey?

A: I value support from friends but tend to exercise independently due to a lack of availability when reaching out.
B: Usually train on my own because I don't want to change my schedule to accommodate others who want to exercise with me; do value vocal support from friends and family though
C: Not at all
D: I find it important to be able to track my progress amongst like my friends and see how other people are doing but at the same time, I feel like there are times when I want to keep my activity private or with only close friends as fitness is something that can be quite personal
E: I find the social aspect of fitness important but prefer for it to be done with just current or close friends, as I don’t feel comfortable letting anyone just see my activity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) What features do you find most useful in a fitness tracker app?

A: Any scoring system (possibly with points) to keep myself engaged and entertained.
B: A clear definition of exercises when focusing on different muscle groups rather than deciding on the variety of exercises and schedule on my own.
C: Heart rate tracker, calories burned tracker, total distance covered per day
D: The exercise function of the app, and having a variety of options would be something I find valuable, more so than a diet section
E: Being able to see how much time has been spent exercising, I value the actual fitness side a lot more than the social and community aspect
F: If I were to design a fitness app, I'd focus on simplicity and customization. Personalised workout plans and progress tracking would be key.
G: If I were to craft a fitness app, I'd prioritise user-friendly features and customizable options. Tailored workout plans and seamless progress tracking would take precedence.
H: If I were to create a fitness app, I'd focus on simplicity and personalization. Customised workout plans and easy progress tracking would be at the core.
I: A personalized workout plan feature is crucial, allowing users to tailor routines based on their goals. Real-time progress tracking and nutritional insights are also essential.
J: An app focused on variety and flexibility would be ideal. Customizable workout options and an intuitive interface would encourage me to explore more activities.
K: A straightforward app that encourages occasional exercise without overwhelming details. Minimalistic design and ease of use are key.
L: For me, the most important feature would be calorie-tracking and tracking how many calories I’ve burnt from each exercise or from just day-to-day walking and such.
M: I think a fitness/exercise plan for me to track the exercises I should/need to do. I think it would help me to find out new exercises that are beneficial for my strength training and remove exercises from my plan that are not as beneficial as others are.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) If you had any issues with the app, how would you like to give feedback / receive support?

A: Chatbot/Livechat feature to quickly find solutions to current issues or an anonymous form to send feedback to developers.
B: Would prefer to email developers regarding major concerns when using the app and to receive support.
C: Have a clear section of the app dedicated to submitting support requests, perhaps giving a rough timeline of when requests will be looked upon (5 working days etc)
D: You know those chatbots at the bottom of the screen, you don’t need to talk to someone, it’s more straightforward and convenient
E: I would prefer a chatbot since if I had an issue, I don’t feel comfortable directly talking to another person on a phone call etc
F: If I had any issues with the app, I'd prefer a user-friendly feedback option within the app itself. Quick responses and clear instructions for troubleshooting would be great.
G: Should I encounter any glitches with the app, I'd prefer an intuitive in-app feedback mechanism. Prompt responses and clear guidance on issue resolution would be highly appreciated.
H: If I run into any issues with the app, I'd prefer a straightforward feedback option right there in the app. Quick responses and clear guidance on how to fix things would be super helpful.
I: A seamless in-app feedback option is my preference. Quick response times and a comprehensive knowledge base for self-help are essential for user support.
J: A user-friendly feedback option within the app is my go-to. Simple troubleshooting guides and occasional tips keep me engaged.
K: If I encounter issues, an easy-to-use support option within the app would be convenient. Clear instructions for basic problems are appreciated.
L: I think the easiest way to receive support would be a live chat to talk with an agent who knows how to navigate the app.
M: I would want to give feedback via a form to explain any errors or bad situations I’ve encountered, and maybe an email conversation with an agent to communicate when I need help.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) What are your privacy and security concerns when using a fitness app?

A: Wouldn't like my info available to other users though happy to share with developers if used only for further development of the app.
B: Not too concerned about sharing information regarding fitness tracking as I do not see the benefit others would have with that information.
C: None.
D: Probably things to do with location, if I track my run on the app, I don’t want other people to be able to see my precise location
E: No concerns with general privacy and security in terms of sharing the information such as location and age etc with the app, I just wouldn’t want this information to be seen by other people
L: I don’t want my information to be available to others unless it is for beneficial reasons to help myself or to help a personal trainer to understand my goals and situations.
M: Personally, I don’t mind my information being shared as I believe my information isn’t something life-changing or secretive for me to hide.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) How do you prefer to receive feedback and encouragement when using a fitness app?

A: Any scoring/points system that would keep me engaged and entertained while I keep track of my exercises.
B: Enjoy the idea of having to take care of a 'virtual pet' when using a fitness app- for example, virtual pet has to be taken care of daily which would encourage me to maintain a consistent schedule. This would serve as a visual aid to determine progress.
C: Feedback maybe in the form of comparing workouts/runs to the average person of same weight/height/age etc, not bothered about any encouragement
D: I like when fitness apps give like daily motivation reminders and things saying you’re doing a good job, and like maybe giving a more visual representation of the work you’ve done, and not just numbers of calories burnt. For example, you have lost 5kg this is the same weight as a watermelon, would keep me more engaged.
E: Things like motivation reminders, and being able to quickly see like a graph of my progress to see where I’m improving
